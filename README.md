# CS-300-Analysis-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This course covered various data models, including Binary Trees, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists, and their suitable applications within different contexts.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I aimed to grasp the relative strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and apply them when their strengths outweighed their weaknesses.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I resolved any issues by consulting the official documentation of the method or searching for example uses. Occasionally, I created a small prototype code element that was simple and then expanded it as the logic became more complex.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The projects made me consider performance and how to approach algorithmic design. It also revealed that I don't naturally think recursively, which is a weakness in some of my potential designs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I believe that practice is key to mastering these elements. I have a common function that I use as a prototype based on my experiences. I might consider taking a few other elements I frequently reuse and developing them into libraries.
